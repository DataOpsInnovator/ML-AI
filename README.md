# Machine Learning & AI

This repository contains various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) projects, including model development, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
The repository focuses on different machine learning algorithms, data science techniques, and deployment strategies.

## Contents:
- Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for training ML models.
- Datasets used in various ML projects.
- Implementations of various ML algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks).
- Model evaluation techniques and performance metrics.
- Guides for deploying models into production.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
         git clone https://github.com/DataOpsInnovator/ML-AI.git

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

         pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts to learn about different ML models and techniques.

4. Refer to each notebook/script for specific instructions on running models and interpreting results.
